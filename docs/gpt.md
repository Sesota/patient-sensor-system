I have a "patient health sensors monitoring" project for my Computer Science BSc. ending which is written in django mainly. Users are divided into "supervisor" and "patient" roles and patients select supervisor and datasources that they want the supervisor to monitor in the system and supervisors can define a criteria on the each datasource to receive an alert if the criteria was true. And participants register sensor collection devices on their account which will upload the sensory data to the server. I need to write a 40 page report for the project. Please generate its table of contents.

# Details

## Security and Privacy considerations
Data Encryption: Describe the methods used to encrypt patient data both in transit and at rest, including any encryption algorithms used and the process for key management.

Authentication and Authorization: Describe the methods used to authenticate and authorize users, including any authentication protocols and frameworks used.

Access Control: Explain the methods used to control access to patient data, including role-based access control and any other mechanisms used to restrict access to sensitive data.

Vulnerability Management: Describe the process used to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities in the system, including any vulnerability scanners or penetration testing tools used.

Incident Response: Describe the incident response plan and procedures in place to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents, including any incident response teams or incident management systems used.

Compliance: Explain how the system is designed to meet relevant regulatory compliance requirements, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) or GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

Privacy: Elaborate on the measures taken to protect patient's privacy and keep their sensitive information confidential, including how the system is designed to minimize the collection and retention of unnecessary data, and ensuring that data is only shared with authorized parties.

Risk assessment: Describing the process of risk assessment that was followed during the design and development of the system and the risks that were identified and addressed.

## Background and motivation

Problem statement: Describe the problem or issue that the project aims to address, including any relevant statistics or data that demonstrate the need for a solution.

Current solutions: Provide an overview of existing solutions or approaches to the problem, and explain their limitations and why they are inadequate to address the problem.

Innovation: Describe the unique features of the patient health sensors monitoring project and how it is different from existing solutions.

Impact: Explain the potential impact that the project could have on patients, healthcare providers, and the healthcare system as a whole.

Research question: Clearly stating the main research question that the project aims to answer

Relevance: Explain how the project is relevant to current trends in healthcare technology and how it aligns with the overall goals and objectives of the healthcare system.

Significance: Elaborating on the significance of the project and how it contributes to the field and addresses a gap in the literature.

## Abstract (not recommended)

In this project, we developed a "patient health sensors monitoring" system using the Django framework. The system allows for the creation of two types of user accounts: "supervisor" and "patient." Patients can select a supervisor and the data sources they want the supervisor to monitor, while supervisors can set criteria for each data source to receive alerts if the criteria are met. The system also allows for the registration of sensor collection devices, which upload sensor data to the server.

The system architecture is based on a three-tier model, with a web interface for user interaction, a server for data processing, and a database for data storage. The web interface is built using the Django framework and utilizes JavaScript for dynamic functionality. The server uses Python for data processing, and the database is built using MySQL.

We evaluated the system through user testing and by measuring system performance. Our results show that the system is user-friendly and easy to navigate, and that the data processing capabilities of the server can handle a high volume of sensor data.

However, we also identified some limitations, such as the need for further security measures to protect sensitive patient data, and the need for additional features to improve the system's scalability.
